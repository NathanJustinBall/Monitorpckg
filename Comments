Config is ajust a basic example of what this version of montoring can do, 
SETUP is not used in this version
RESULT_DB:
  Governs setup information related to storing data in your database.
  
JOB_DB:
  Much like result, stores the jobs that are to be checked.
  
from then on out, titles are considerd as jobs, they must include a url and a string to check for as well as a max timeout.
